/**
 * Event is a report of an event somewhere in the cluster.  Events have a limited retention time and triggers and messages may evolve with time.  Event consumers should not rely on the timing of an event with a given Reason reflecting a consistent underlying trigger, or the continued existence of events with that Reason.  Events should be treated as informative, best-effort, supplemental data.
 *
 * @param involvedObject 
 * @param metadata 
 * @param action What action was taken/failed regarding to the Regarding object.
 * @param apiVersion APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
 * @param count The number of times this event has occurred.
 * @param eventTime MicroTime is version of Time with microsecond level precision.
 * @param firstTimestamp Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.
 * @param kind Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
 * @param lastTimestamp Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.
 * @param message A human-readable description of the status of this operation.
 * @param reason This should be a short, machine understandable string that gives the reason for the transition into the object's current status.
 * @param related 
 * @param reportingComponent Name of the controller that emitted this Event, e.g. `kubernetes.io/kubelet`.
 * @param reportingInstance ID of the controller instance, e.g. `kubelet-xyzf`.
 * @param series 
 * @param source 
 * @param type Type of this event (Normal, Warning), new types could be added in the future
